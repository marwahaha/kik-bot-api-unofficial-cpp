# kik-bot-api-unofficial-cpp
kik-bot-api-unofficial-cpp is an xmpp client for writing unofficial bots towards Kik xmpp server, it follows the same method as the python version, but there will be some new features such as the ability to send images and more.

there are stages each stage represents a 
functionality for example stage1 is the 
xmpp client sending messages to a 
particular user, stage2 will be about 
sending an image to a particular group. and 
stage3, etc are now being thought of, once
you've decided which stage you will be
using make sure to always check the source
code since you will always have to add
something such as how you want the bot to
respond, etc. after you're done gathering
you can use g++ to compile the particular
stages together and run it, and now you 
have a smooth running bot(and note that the
user and pass that you put in stage1 will
always be where the bot logs in from).

Note: Make sure to look at the code for 
documentation per each stage.
